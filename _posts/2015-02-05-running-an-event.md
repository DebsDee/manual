### Do you want to bring Codebar to your city?

Part of Codebar's goal is to enable anyone wanting to run our events in their city on a regular basis by supporting them in any way we can. If this is something that you would like to do, we suggest that you first try and find a venue for the first two events and sponsors that can provide you with food.

We will then add your chapter to codebar.io and provide you with organiser access and any other mailing lists and accounts so that you can manage things.

We can also help by

- promoting your workshops through twitter

- reaching out to help you find venues and coaches

- offering access to all of our chapter organisers who can help and support your effort

- spreading the word and getting local sponsorship

- sharing our tutorials and community input


If you are struggling with either finding a venue or someone to cover food costs, we might be able to help by covering some of the costs or reaching out to our extended network. Just let us know.


### Workshops

#### What do I need from a host?

- **Space**. The requirement is different depending on the city. A workshop can be as small as 5-6 people or as big as 80 - or more if you have enough people helping out! Just make sure that the venue space details is configured properly in the application before you send out any invitations.

- **Desks and chairs**. Enough desks and chairs for everyone!

- **WiFi and power**. The venue needs to have a fairly good and stable internet connection and enough power sockets for all the student laptops.

*Optional*

- **A projector and screen**. A projector is nice to have as you can use it to host lightning talks  and to project the [Welcome to Codebar](http://wip) slides.


#### Anything else?

- **Food and drinks**. Learning to code after a long day at work can be hard. Offering food and giving people the opportunity to take a break and have something to eat before we get started makes our events more effective and accessible. You should also ask for vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options and also non-alcoholic drinks. The effort is minimal and then everyone can have something to eat. If you are stuck, ask us for suggestions!

Not all companies are able to provide both space and food. If you need help finding a sponsor let us know.

#### Announcing workshops and sending out invitations

You should aim to list your events at least a week before they take place to give people time to learn and sign up to the event. When creating an event, you should make sure to not set it as `invitable` unless registrations are open.

Anyone signed up to Codebar will be able to RSVP to the event through the workshop page but only people subscribed to your chapter will receive an email invitation.

To find out more about how to manage the Codebar application read our [Organiser Guide]().

#### Name badges

We have found that using name badges helps out a lot. It's not easy neither for the organisers nor for the attendees to remember everyone else's name, and it also enables everyone to know who they are talking to. Usually the host companies are able to handle printing the badges, so you should ask them!

If your workshops are small it should also be easy to just write the name on the labels as people attend. Using different color markers to help distinguish who is a student and coach can be helpful.

[Big First Name](http://big.first.name) has kindly offered us a free account that we use to print stickers. You should be able to find the details in our shared password vault. To get a list of the attendees, go to your workshop's admin page and click on 'Export attendees'. If someone else is helping you out with that, they can also export the list of names by appending '.csv' to their invitation URL.

You can also use different color stickers for the organisers and anyone helping out so that attendees know who to speak to if they need any help.


### At the event

Check in people through the workshop admin page as they come and hand them out their name tag. This will enable you to track demand, enforce the Codebar attendance policy and also put people in groups before the workshop kicks off. The coaches will also only start appearing in the [coach ranking](http://codebar.io/coaches) after their attendance is confirmed.

Make sure the WiFi details are displayed in a prominent place.

Depending on the size of the event we tend to spend the first half an hour having food and socialising before we pair people up around 19:00 (if we start at 18:30) and get started with coding. In some of our chapters we also run 5-minute lightning talks. You are encouraged to try  things out and see how it works better for you. Just remember to keep things going and allow the students at least 1:30 hour, if not more, of learning.


### After the event

Encourage attendees to go to a caf√© or the pub. Usually people don't get that much time to interact at the events and this enables them to expand their tech social circle, find our about opportunities and meet like-minded people.


## Dealing with problems

Part of your job as organiser is to make sure that everyone feels welcome and comfortable. This might occasionally mean that you have to deal with small issues or potentially ban people from attending Codebar events.

This is not something that anyone enjoys doing, however, our attendees are our priority and we need to make sure that Codebar's [Code of Conduct](http://codebar.io/code-of-conduct) is enforced.

If someone comes to you with a complain, act on it. If attendees are involved, speak to them or send them an email after the event. If you feel that you are unable to deal with this, you are more than welcome to send an email to london@codebar.io and we will do our best to help you out or deal with any issues.
