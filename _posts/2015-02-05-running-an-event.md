## Before the event

You'll need to find someone to host and publicise the event. If you're dealing with an established chapter, listing it on the website & sending invites might be sufficient publicity (London sells out every week). There's also the Twitter accounts, Facebook, and developer mailing lists that can be used. 

### Host requirements
A Codebar host should have: 

- **Space for the attendees**. In London we aim for a minimum capacity of 50, with occasional exceptions. 
	- **Desks and chairs**. As well as room to gather, the attendees need to sit with each other and work. 
- **Wifi and power**. Attendees will definitely need access to the internet, to access their projects, documentation, and the Codebar tutorials. Most students run off battery power but some people's laptops won't last the full session (or will be empty after a full day at work) so some desks should have access to power. 
- **Food and drink**. Food should include vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options. Drinks should include a non-alcoholic range; alcohol isn't required. The food budget normally comes to just over Â£200 for 60-70 people. 
- **A projector and screen**. If you're hosting a lightning talk, you'll need a projector, a screen, and an area for people to watch it. You can also use it to project the "Welcome to Codebar" slides.  

### Name badges
2 hours before the event: print attendee stickers. You can ask the host to handle this, but printing stickers is hard work and has a lot of opportunities to go wrong. You'll probably feel better if you handle it yourself. We use [Big First Name](http://big.first.name) to print stickers. If you visit a Codebar invite page and add ".csv" to the end (eg. http://codebar.io/invite/abc123.csv) you'll get a CSV export of all the attendees that can be uploaded to Big First Name. 
In London, we've started adding blue star stickers to helper & organiser name badges, to help attendees find people if they need help. This isn't necessary for smaller events. 

## At the event
Arrive early, and find a good place to act as your "front desk". Connect your laptop to the wifi, and lay out your stickers so you can see all of them. It's a lot easier than leafing through a pile to find the correct one. 
If you're having a lightning talk, make sure that your host is expecting that & has handled the projector setup (if appropriate). Find out where the toilets are, and where the best place is for the attendees to gather. Ideally, after people have been checked in you want them away from the front desk. 
Make sure the wifi details are prominently displayed. 

If your event starts at 6:30pm, try to start the lightning talk at 6:55pm and run the pairing at 7pm. You should start wrapping up at 9pm. Things will run over, but do your best. 

### Running the front desk
When an attendee arrives at the event: 

1. Welcome them to Codebar. Ask them for their name. 
2. Look them up in the Codebar website admin interface. Click the "Attended" button. Hand them their sticker.
3. If they're a new attendee, ask them if they've read the code of conduct. Get an experienced student/coach to give them an induction. 
4. If they're a student, ask them what they're working on: "Are you working on a Codebar tutorial or your own project?" If it's their own project, ask them what language they're using. Write that down on the pairing worksheet. 
5. Direct them where they should go next. If the toilets aren't clearly signed, tell them where they are. 
6. Give them a friendly sign-off. "Have a great time!" or similar. 

### Pairing of students & coaches
*NB. This section is geared towards helping deal with audiences of 50-70 people. You won't need it for smaller groups.*
Some standard public speaking advice will help here:

- Use a loud voice. Smile, and make eye contact. Use exagerrated hand gestures. 
- Don't wait for silence. People will shut up more quickly if you just talk loudly and plough on. 
- Tell people more than once what to do. You can't be too clear about it. Remember: you're in charge.
- Fake as much enthusiasm as you can. 
- If people have already started sitting down, get them to stand up by dividing the room. If they're sitting down they'll be less quick to move when you've paired them up. 
- If nobody volunteers to coach, pick on an individual. "Can I get a coach for some PHP? No? Bob, how about you work with this student?"

You should have a good idea of how many coaches you have in the room from the admin interface, and an idea of how many tutorial/project students you have from the worksheet. 

Here's the kind of thing I say when doing the pairing: 
"GOOD EVENING! HELLO! Welcome to Codebar! It's great to see so many people here tonight. We're going to divide up into groups now, so if I could have all the coaches on the left hand side of the room please, and all the students on the right hand side. That's coaches on my left, students on the right. Coaches, left. Students, right. 
Okay, and out of the students, if you're working on a Codebar tutorial stand over here, by the hat rack, and if you've brought your own project stand over here by the table. Tutorials by the hat rack, and projects by the table. Thank you!"

If you've arranged people into groups ahead of time, get the students to come forward and ask for a coach volunteer: 
"Can Alice, Rob, and Emma step forward? Thank you! You're working on one of the Ruby tutorials, correct? Great! Can I have a coach for Ruby, please? Jason, perfect. You've got Alice, Rob, and Emma tonight. Head on over to the tables." 

If you haven't, then you'll need to create groups on the fly. We try to emphasise the tutorials, so it's best to start with those. Split people up by topic, then (based on the numbers) divide them up into tutorial groups. Something like this: 

"Okay, students working on tutorials. Who's working on the first HTML/CSS tutorials? Hands high in the air, please! Great, I'm going to take Judy and Fernando. Can I have a coach for HTML1? Paul, fantastic. Judy and Fernando, you'll be working with Paul."

### Closing the event
At 9PM, go around and tell people it's packing up time and tell them about which pub we're going to afterwards. Everyone will ignore you, so you'll have to go round the room and tell them again. Eventually you need to stand next to them and not say anything. It will take you at least 20 minutes to get everyone out. 
If a venue has a PA system, use it. 
To really make people leave, it helps to create an atmosphere of "the end". Start tidying up (even if the host says you shouldn't worry about it), dim the lights. Have someone start taking people to the pub, if you can. 

### Dealing with problems 
Most events are trouble-free. Remember that part of your job as organiser is to be the hard-ass disciplinarian when necessary. That might be telling someone to stop talking during a presentation, to leave the venue when the event's over, or not to take all the Mars bars from the host's kitchen. Be nice but firm. 
If an attendee comes to you with a complaint, don't get defensive. Tell them you're sorry it happened, and you'll do your best to sort it out. Ask them if there's anything you can do right now to help. If possible, give them space away from the main event where people can't overhear your conversation. 

## After the event
Go to the pub. You can ask other attendees how it was for them, and meet people. This is probably your best time to chat, as you'll be busy at the event itself. 

1 day after the event you should email the host to say thank you. This is also a good time to ask them if they'd be interested in hosting again in the future. If you include some dates they can say 'yes' right then.
