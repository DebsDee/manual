# Helping at Codebar events

Codebar workshops are a team effort. It's really hard for one person to do it on their own, and nearly impossible if you have more than around 10 attendees. 
As a helper, you're key to making the event go smoothly. Here's some tips: 

- Try to get to the event a little early: 5 minutes or so before the listed start time. 
- Be friendly, positive, and encouraging - even if you're feeling stressed out. 
- During the initial socialising period, try to be close at hand to the front desk where people are being checked in. That way you're close by to give inductions & help with tasks. Once you've finished an induction or helping with something, head back to the front desk. 
- Try not to get caught up in conversations. If you're a helper you'll know lots of people; tell them you'll chat to them after the event. 
- Look out for people who are on their own. See if they're OK and try to introduce them to someone to talk to. 
- If you spot someone without a name badge, chances are they're not checked in. That's a problem when we're doing the pairing. Send them over to the front desk to get a sticker. 
- If someone comes to you with a complaint or a concern, it's not necessarily your job to fix it. The rest of the organisers & helpers have your back. But you should tell the person you're sorry, and you'll do your best to resolve it. 
- Be on the lookout for chances to connect people. For instance, if a new student tells you she's a designer, do you know any other attendees with an interest in design you could introduce her to? 


## Coach inductions
1. Have they read the code of conduct? 
2. Have they done any teaching before? Most people have done something, even if it's just helping mentor some people at work. 
3. Explain the difference between teaching and coaching: the goal isn't mainly to impart knowledge. It's to guide the student, to stop them from getting stuck in a dead end, and to encourage them. 
4. When sitting down with a student, it's useful to ask them what they've done in the past and why they're at Codebar. If they attended in the past, ask the student to explain what they worked on last time. 
5. Don't take over the student's keyboard. If the coach is typing, the student's not learning.
6. Try to answer a question with a question. Help the student find out the answers themselves, rather than providing the answer. ("Why isn't my code working?" "How could we find out?") 
7. If a student gives a correct answer, it can be a good followup to ask the student how they know it's correct (or why it's correct).
8. If they're working with a group, try to give all students a fair amount of attention. It doesn't have to be equal but it should be fair. Setting students tasks can help with this. ("While I'm helping Anne, you should finish writing this function.")
9. If they need any help, look for a helper or organiser. 
10. We go to the pub afterwards, which is a great way to meet new people. They should come!

## Student inductions
1. Have they read the code of conduct? 
2. How did they hear about Codebar? What made them want to come along? 
3. What development have they done before? Do they have a goal in mind? (eg. Are they trying to build their own web app? A portfolio? etc.) 
4. If they're a complete beginner: 
	1. Type everything in, don't copy and paste. 
	2. You'll make a lot of mistakes and things won't work. That's OK. It's important to be "happy to fail". Suggest the student ask the coach how many times they've written code that works first time. 
5. Remember that Codebar's not just about learning to code - it's also about making friends & meeting people with similar goals. Encourage them to chat to other people and come to the pub afterwards. 
6. If they need any help or have any concerns, look for a helper or organiser.
7. We go to the pub afterwards, which is a great way to meet new people. They should come!
