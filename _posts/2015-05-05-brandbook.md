### Font & typography

In our logos and logotype we use a free webfont called Monda. You can download Monda from github [here](https://github.com/vernnobile/mondaFont)

If you need to edit any of our assets, please use this font by downloading it and including it in your font library.

### Language

We ALWAYS write codebar with a lowercase c, as opposed to a capital C. This is true even if codebar is the first word in a sentence.

When we refer to codebar in writing we use the short verison - codebar - as opposed to the long version - codebar.io - which we use in the logos.

The different codebar locations are called chapters. When we refer to a specific  codebar chapter, we write codebar first and then the chapter name we are referring to.
