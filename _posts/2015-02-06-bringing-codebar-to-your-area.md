### Do you want to bring codebar to your city?

Part of our goal is to enable people to organise workshops in their city on a regular basis by supporting them in every we can. If this is something that you would like to do, we suggest that you first try and find a venue for the first two events and sponsors that can provide you with food.

We will also add your chapter to the codebar application and provide you with organiser access, a mailing list where people subscribed to your city can reach out to you and more information on how to use the app to announce and invite people to workshops.

We can also help by

- promoting your workshops through twitter

- reaching out for venues and coaches

- offering access to all of our chapter organisers who can help and support your effort

- spreading the word and getting local sponsorship

- sharing our tutorials and community input


If you are struggling to either find a venue or a sponsor to cover food costs, we might be able to help. Just let us know.

But first, you should read our [Code of Conduct](http://codebar.io/code-of-conduct) and the [values](/codebar-values.html) that represent us.
