### Do you want to bring Codebar to your city?

Part of Codebar's goal is to enable anyone wanting to run our events in their city on a regular basis by supporting them in any way we can. If this is something that you would like to do, we suggest that you first try and find a venue for the first two events and sponsors that can provide you with food.

We will then add your chapter to codebar.io and provide you with organiser access and any other mailing lists and accounts so that you can manage things.

We can also help by

- promoting your workshops through twitter

- reaching out to help you find venues and coaches

- offering access to all of our chapter organisers who can help and support your effort

- spreading the word and getting local sponsorship

- sharing our tutorials and community input


If you are struggling with either finding a venue or someone to cover food costs, we might be able to help by covering some of the costs or reaching out to our extended network. Just let us know.
