# Codebar Sponsorship

Codebar is a UK-based not-for-profit organisation that has been running weekly front-end developer workshops since 2013.

During this time, we have coached over 300 hundred students, with more and more people applying to be students or coaches every week. This has grown our developer base rapidly in a short period and substantially increased demand for coaches. This in turn requires a substantial expansion in sponsorship investment. (Despo – it would be good to have more numbers on students/coaches).

Workshops are currently held on a weekday evening in London, Brighton and Cambridge. More cities will be added in 2015, starting with Glasgow and Edinburgh. If you are a sponsor based in another UK city, we’d be delighted to talk to you about hosting and sponsoring regular events.


In addition to our weekly workshops, we hold special one-day events for existing and new students on specific topics. These are topics we know are interesting and relevant to our students for their career or business development.

All Codebar’s events are run on a volunteer basis, with every subject expert and coach giving their time for free.

Despite the fact that our events are run on this basis, there are of course still costs associated with both the general running of Codebar as well as our specific events.

## Why should you sponsor?

As a sponsor of any of Codebar’s events, you will be part of the vibrant community facilitating the growth of not only female developers in the UK, but also other under-represented groups. We have a strict yet simple code of conduct that includes more detailed information (use hyperlink).
You will be helping to promote diversity within this country’s tech sector and be part of an exciting community committed to narrowing the skills gap in this sector. Not only that, but you will also be contributing to the growth of much-needed technical skills giving a further boost to the UK’s post-recession economy.

Your sponsorship will enable more [women] to get started in front-end development, and many others to raise their skills to the next level. You will also have contact with developers of all levels at our workshops. Many of Codebar’s students have found jobs as a direct result of the time they have invested to learn and develop their coding skills with us.
Whatever investment you choose, your logo will appear on the Codebar website along with a link to your site. You will also be given between 5 to 10 minutes at the beginning of an evening workshop you host to talk about your business and raise your profile among students and coaches.
At our one-day events, there will be slots available throughout the day to tell participants about your organisation.

Other sponsorship benefits include promotion through the Codebar website and our social media channels, e.g. Twitter, Facebook etc.  (should we say more about this?)
