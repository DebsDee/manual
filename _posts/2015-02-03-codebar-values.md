title: "Codebar's values"
---

* **Codebar's goal is to build a community and teach coding to people from under-represented groups**. We do this by running weekly workshops, one-off events and courses. We are building a community that connects them to both others who are interested in learning to code and people who are already part of the industry and can help them out in their first steps.

* **Codebar is friendly and encouraging**. The atmosphere should be one of co-operating and non-judgement. People should help each other out, peer-to-peer.

* **Codebar is accessible.** All Codebar events should be free.

* **Codebar exists to help the students**. Any giveaways or special offers are only made available to our students. We don't act as a mailing list for our coaches unless this has a direct impact in helping promote diversity in the tech industry or teach people programming for free.

* **Codebar is open source**. We rely on the help of the community to improve our [website](https://github.com/codebar/planner) and [tutorials](https://github.com/codebar/tutorials). If you have some time we would really appreciate your help! If you can't find any open issues that you can work on, send us an email to `london at codebar.io` and we should be able to help out!
