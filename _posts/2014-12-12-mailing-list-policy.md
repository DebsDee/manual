Codebar is a registered charity dedicated to promoting diversity in the technology/development industry.
We encourage active involvement in the ?tech?community and are keen to communicate ?offers? to our students that would benefit their education and we would love to hear from you but ask you adhere to the following principles:

- Strictly no offers priced over £200 to be sent to students or coaches  - ?add as a footnote (excluding courses offered at 30% discount (to RRP) to Codebar Students )?

- All offers/courses sent must be aimed at beginner/intermediate level coders/coaches

- All communication sent via the Codebar mailing list must align with the Codebar mission statement  - (?maybe add as a footnote?)

- No abusive, exclusionary or discriminatory language may be sent to via the Codebar mailing list

- No auto-generated emails may be sent to Codebar students via the Codebar mailing list

- If a member requests that they are not contacted this must be respected and all subsequent communication must be terminated 

- Any messages that deviate from this policy may be accepted at the sole discretion of key Codebar staff (?define who these people are?)

- All communication must relate to a specific ?technology based skill? - should this relate to coding only? or also presentation skills etc...
