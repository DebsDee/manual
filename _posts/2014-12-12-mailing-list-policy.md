title:  "Mailing List Policy"
---

Codebar is a non profit dedicated to promoting diversity in the technology/software development industry. We encourage active involvement in the tech community and are keen to communicate information to our students that would benefit their education.

We have dedicated mailing lists for our students, as well as a weekly email inviting people to the next event. If you would like to promote something to our audience we would love to hear from you but ask you adhere to the following principles:

- Strictly no paid courses
	We spend a lot of our time trying to create opportunities and run free events for Codebar students. If you would like to run a free version of your course for us or offer free spots to an event you are running we would love to have a chat with you.

- Any offers/courses sent must be aimed at beginner to intermediate level developers and should specify the prerequisites and background knowledge required for someone to attend.

- All communication that you want us to forward to the Codebar mailing list must align with the Codebar mission statement and Code of Conduct.

- No abusive, exclusionary or discriminatory language may be sent to via the Codebar mailing list

- No auto-generated emails may be sent to Codebar students via the Codebar mailing list

- Any messages that deviate from this policy may be accepted at the sole discretion of the Codebar organisers
