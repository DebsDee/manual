Codebar is a non profit dedicated to promoting diversity in the technology/software development industry.  We encourage active involvement in the tech community and are keen to communicate information to our students that would benefit their education.

We would love to [hear from you](mailto:hello@codebar.io) but ask you adhere to the following principles:

- Strictly no paid courses
	We spend a lot of our time trying to create opportunities and run free events for Codebar students. If you would like to run a free version of your course for us or offer free spots to an event you are running we would love to have a chat with you.

- Any offers/courses sent must be aimed at beginner to intermediate level developers and should specify if any pre-requisites should be met for someone to attend.

- All communication that you want us to forward to the Codebar mailing list must align with the Codebar mission statement

- No abusive, exclusionary or discriminatory language may be sent to via the Codebar mailing list

- No auto-generated emails may be sent to Codebar students via the Codebar mailing list

- Any messages that deviate from this policy may be accepted at the sole discretion of the Codebar organisers
