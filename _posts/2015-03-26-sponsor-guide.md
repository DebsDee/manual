### Running a codebar workshop

So you've decided to become a sponsor and host a codebar workshop. Great! Here's what you need to know to run a successful codebar event. 

#### Before the workshop

Find a food supplier for the event. If you need help finding places to order from, get in touch with your local chapter organisers and they'll help you find a place.

Besides food attendees will need access to at least water, so plan accordingly. If you are planning to serve other drinks find a supplier for these too.

Check if you have suitable WIFI in your office/event space. If you are hosting one of the larger chapters, plan for a large number of people all trying to connect to your network all at once.

Make sure you have enough power outlets in the space you are planning to use. If not it might be a good idea to purchase some extension cords as people will have to plug their laptops in somewhere.

Some workshops have a lightning talk so make sure we have access to a projector. If you would like to do a lightning talk at the workshop you host please let the chapter organisers know in advance so they can plan for it.

Send us a transparent png version of your logo so we can set up the event page on our site. We usually do this a week in advance.

It would be really helpful if you could print name tags for the event. To do this you need to buy some generic printing labels. We usually use 2 x 7 layout.

#### On the day of the workshop

Order the food. Please ask them to have it delivered by 6:30PM, the official start time of the workshop. Don't forget about vegetarian and gluten-free options.

A codebar organiser will send you an email with the final head count and any other detail that might've come up in the meantime. We can also send you a list of attendees, so if you need this let us know. However, please be aware that the list changes up until the last minute so it might not be 100% accurate. If you are printing name tags we will also send you a PDF with all the attendees that you can use to print the tags on a desktop printer.

If the workshop has a confirmed lightning talk or you are doing one, set up the projector so it's ready to go. Might be a good idea to have a selection on connectors on hand so people with a wide variety of machines can plug into it.

If there are any further questions you have please don't hesitate to get in touch with any of the chapter organisers.

#### At the workshop

One of the chapter organisers will be at the venue 30 min before official start time, around 6:00. They will help you set the up the space and check people in.

Enjoy it :)
